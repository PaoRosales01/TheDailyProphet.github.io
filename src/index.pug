				p Twenty years ago, readers around the world first discovered the magical story of Harry Potter, created by J.K. Rowling. We can now reveal that, since that moment, half a billion Harry Potter books have now been sold. On average, this means one in fifteen people in the world owns a Harry Potter book. The 500 million sales are across the seven books in the series and the three companion volumes, in print and eBook versions. 
				p First published by Bloomsbury in 1997, the books have now been translated into over 80 different languages across the world, with more to come. From Albanian to Azerbaijani to Hebrew to Hawaiian, the stories are becoming accessible to more people all the time.

				div.multi-column-3
					p It’s not uncommon in the muggle world to hear about bank robberies – but it is unusual that you would hear about Muggles trying to rob Wizarding Banks.
					p For the first time in history, a muggle-man was reported to have marched into Gringotts Bank in Diagon Alley at approximately 11am waving around a black wand that was described to project pieces of elemental lead, also known to Muggles as a gun.
					p While no one was hurt during the transgression, the question looms – how exactly did a Muggle get into Diagon Alley and furthermore, what would a Muggle need with Wizarding Currency?
					p When we caught up with one of the Goblins who was at the bank during the time of the incident, he let us know “The man who came into Gringotts did not speak, not even once. He walked in, went straight to the first clerk that was available and passed them a howler. The howler began screaming in a dark ominous voice that if Gringotts did not hand over all Golden Galleons in the bank’s possession, we would all be subject to death. You just cant trust those muggle folk, none of them.”
